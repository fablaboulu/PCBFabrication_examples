# PCBFabrication Examples
We have added all the necessary files to design and fabricate a circuit in Fab Lab Oulu using SMD component. The repository includes:

* A PDF file including a design tutorial
* The design files to create two different boards:
  * A simple design with a button and a LED (Design 1). You can find the tinkercad simulation [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7kGoBq8Yi5c).
  * A simple design to control a RGB LED using arduino (Design 2). You can find the tinkercad simulation [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/i23wB4gbnYI).

## Additional material
* [A video](https://youtu.be/-7NV_vIO7Lk) with some instructions on setting up the SRM-2+
* [A Tutorial on PCB fabrication](https://wiki.oulu.fi/display/FLOWS/Milling)
